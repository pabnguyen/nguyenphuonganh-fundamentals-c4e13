One conditional can also be nested within another. For example, assume we have two integer variables, x and y. 
The following pattern of selection shows how we might decide how they are related to each other.

if x < y:
    print("x is less than y")
else:
    if x > y:
        print("x is greater than y")
    else:
        print("x and y must be equal")
